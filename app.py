# Model description
st.markdown("""
The model takes an input image, processes it through several convolutional and pooling layers to extract visual features (like edges, textures, shapes), and then uses dense (fully connected) layers to classify the image into one of several predefined categories (classes).

It learns patterns in the images during training by comparing its predictions with the true labels and adjusting its internal weights to reduce error. After training, it can be used to predict the class of new, unseen images.

**How to use:**
1. Upload an image using the file uploader below
2. Click the "Classify Image" button
3. See the prediction results
